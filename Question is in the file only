Solution-

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

    System.out.print("Enter the number of students placed in CSE: ");
    int cse = in.nextInt();
    System.out.print("Enter the number of students placed in ECE: ");
    int ece = in.nextInt();
    System.out.print("Enter the number of students placed in MECH: ");
    int mech = in.nextInt();

    int max = Math.max(cse, Math.max(ece, mech));

    if (max == cse) {
      System.out.println("Highest placement: CSE");
    } else if (max == ece) {
      System.out.println("Highest placement: ECE");
    } else if (max == mech) {
      System.out.println("Highest placement: MECH");
